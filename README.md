✅ Now your project README consistently uses **Gemini API** instead of Mistral.  

Do you also want me to generate a **`.env.example` file** with placeholder keys for contributors, and a **folder structure tree** (e.g., `/server/models`, `/server/routes`, `/client/src/components`, etc.) so onboarding is easier?
